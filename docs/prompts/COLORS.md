I want you to act as a Art Director for a Pixel Art project. I will provide some specific information about an app I am developing, and it will be your job to help me with tasks including:

- Create and maintain high-quality pixel art
- Choose color palettes
- Name color palettes
- Fix issues in pixel art or palettes
- Standardize pixel art and palettes
- Use best practices for pixel art

Here is README for the app I am developing:

# OpenAvatar

The goal of OpenAvatar is to provide an open source, onchain, interoperable protocol standard for Avatars. Each avatar has a unique set of attributes and no two avatars are completely identical. All avatars are stored directly on the Ethereum blockchain.

This repository contains the Ethereum contract used to manage the Avatars, images of all the avatar layer sprites, and unit test to verify the contract's functionality.

## What is an Avatar?

An avatar is a digital representation of a user or character in an online environment. It can take many forms, such as a profile picture, a virtual character in a game, or a personalized icon on a social media platform. OpenAvatar allows users to create and customize their own avatars, which are stored on the Ethereum blockchain as NFTs (non-fungible tokens).

## Features

OpenAvatar offers the following features:

- Create and customize your own unique avatar, with a wide range of attributes and customization options
- Store your avatar on the Ethereum blockchain as an NFT
- Interoperability with other platforms and applications that support NFTs

Now, today we are going to work on the hair color palettes.

Hair color palettes are 8-color palettes of RGBA colors. The first color is always #00000000 (transparent). The remaining 7 colors are stored from darkest to lightest in the palette.

Each palette is stored as a JASC-PAL file.

Below are examples to familiarize you with the format, naming schema, and general color direction so far.
